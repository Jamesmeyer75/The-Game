# Project1
This is my first group project. It is a spaceship game that uses AWD keys to move, and the spacebar to fire a laser at
 asteroids flying across the screen. The game ends when your ship gets hit by an asteroid. Enter your name on the GAME OVER
 screen, and your score will display on the leaderboard once you refresh the page. Press PLAY AGAIN to try and beat your 
 score! Here is the link to the game: https://jamesmeyer75.github.io/The-Game/
